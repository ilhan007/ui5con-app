# Application bar

Let`s create this beautiful application bar!
![Alt text](./step1.png?raw=true "App bar")

1. Remove the following files (generated by default) as they would not be needed.
	- src/index.css
	- src/serviceWorker.js
	- src/logo.svg

2. Remove the usage of those files from the ```src/index.js```.

	```js 
	import './index.css';
	import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';
	serviceWorker.unregister();
	```

3. We will use the `ui5-shellbar` for an app bar, so let's import it in the `src/App.js`. The component has several convenient attributes that we are going to use.
Note: We are replacing the `ui5-button` from the previous step with the `ui5-shellbar`.

	```js 
	import "@ui5/webcomponents/dist/ShellBar";

	function App() {
		return (
			<ui5-shellbar
				primary-title="Smart Store Manager"
				show-notifications
				show-product-switch
				show-co-pilot>
			</ui5-shellbar>
		);
	}
	```

4. Create "img" folder under "src" and copy the `logo.png` and `profile.png` files from `src/img` from [Sources of Smart Store](https://github.com/ilhan007/ui5con-app/tree/master/src/img) (look for a "download" button, when you click on one of the images).

5. Then, import those images and set them to the `logo` and `profile` attributes of the `ui5-shellbar`.

	```js 
	import profile from "./img/profile.png";
	import logo from "./img/logo.png";
	import "@ui5/webcomponents/dist/ShellBar";

	function App() {
		return (
			<ui5-shellbar
				primary-title="Smart Store Manager"
				show-notifications
				show-product-switch
				show-co-pilot
				profile={profile}
				logo={logo}>
			</ui5-shellbar>
		);
	}
	```
